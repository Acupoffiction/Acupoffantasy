    <p> After some time passes by it starts to get dark so you both head back to the cart, luckily nothing seems untouched and no one is to be seen.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness, I would feel even worse than your cart ended up damage in our escape. Well, I guess I should turn in for the night and tell Garret- I mean my master that my cover is blown. Again I am really sorry for what occurred today I did not mean to cause you trouble. Here I did promise you I would pay you." He puts his head down as he hands you a heavy bag of gold and you begin to feel even more sorry for him than before.</p>

<p>"No need to apologize, here why not stay a little bit longer, I would not mind talking to you a bit more." Serell looks shocked before giving a small smile.</p>

<p>"I would like that." You smile back and you both sit together on a lone bench with the Moon casting down on the quiet town. Serrell looks down fumbling his hands unsure what to say at first.</p>
<p>"Would you mind if I ask you about yourself? You know before the whole being the chosen one thing."</p>

<p>"After all, I did today I deserve to share as many details as I can."  He then begun to share his story, he was a frail weak child who was bullied to the point of being an outcast. </p>
   <p> But then after he claimed the sword everyone wanted to be close to him even the parents who did not care to love him begin to shower him with endless praise and "love". </p>
       <p>That was when he met his master who took him on this journey to prepare to defeat the evil.</p>

<p>"The moment I found that sword and gain all this power, people have been praising left and right, even calling me a God. At first, it seemed nice to have all this attention you know? Being alone for so long but now...I am glad I have met someone who does not seem to care who I am."</p>

<p>"Of course, it's not right to invade your space and continuing to parade you around. You have the right to have space."</p>

<p>"Heh, if only my Master had the same thoughts as you do." Serell muttered under his breath."</p>

<p>"Hm?"</p>

<p>"Nevermind, it is getting rather late. Do you need me to walk you to the inn?"</p>

<p>"No, no it's alright I can walk by myself see you tomorrow Serrell!"</p>
    <p>He nods with a smile and waves goodbye and you proceeded to head into the inn. As you lay in the warm bed under covers you ponder over what happened today before sleeping soundly.</p>
