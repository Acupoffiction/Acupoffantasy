     <p> After some time passes by it starts to get dark so you both head back to the cart, luckily nothing seems untouched and no one is to be seen.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness, I would feel even worse than your cart ended up damage in our escape. Well, I guess I should turn in for the night and tell Garret- I mean my master that my cover is blown. Again I am really sorry for what occurred today I did not mean to cause you trouble. Here I did promise you I would pay you." He starts to leave before you shout at him.
</p>

<p>"Hey! You didn't pay me!" </p>
    <p>"O-Oh I'm so sorry, how much is it?"Serrell says as he fumbles trying to hand you gold coins, you've got sick of watching him and push the money back into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Nevermind you can keep it after all you ended up not liking the coffee." 
    <p>"Okay then..."Awkward silence begins to take play as you kept noticing Serrell looking back and forth at you. You sigh as you look away from him.</p>
    <p>"Spill it."</p>
        <p>"Huh?"</p>
            <p>"You keep looking at me like you want to say something so come on I don't have all night."</p>
<p>"Of course, after all, I did today I deserve to share as many details as I can about myself." He then begun to share his story, he was a frail weak child who was bullied to the point of being an outcast. </p>
   <p> But then after he claimed the sword everyone wanted to be close to him even the parents who did not care to love him begin to shower him with endless praise and "love". </p>
       <p>That was when he met his master who took him on this journey to prepare to defeat the evil.</p>

<p>"The moment I found that sword, people have been praising left and right, even calling me a God. At first, it seemed nice to have all this attention you know? Being alone for so long."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you shouldn't have any attention on you at all, you're too awkward and you can't handle any pressure of people breathing on your neck."</p>
    <p>"Do you think I should try to gain confidence?"</p>
    <p>"No, you should just stop trying to be something you're not at all."</p>
   <p> "I wonder what my master would think of you..." Serrell muttered under his breath.</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"Nevermind, it is getting rather late. I should be on my way, see you tomorrow?" You huff and wave him off, packing up your cart and heading off to the inn.
