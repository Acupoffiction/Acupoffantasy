Kohane is a thief that frequently steals treasures from the castle, he is fond of juicy foods. He ends up becoming Snowdrop's only friend and loves to flirt with her and anyone who meets his eye. It seems like he knows that you are not from this world and keeps trying to figure you out, on the other hand, he gets bored very easily and tries to go for bigger steals not caring at all about the danger.
