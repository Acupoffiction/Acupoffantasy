       <p>"What does my childhood have to do with anything?"</p>

<p>"I'm just reminding you that you are still that sad pathetic excuse of a child that you still are now." Serell begins to give you a blank expression waiting for you to finish.</p>

<p>"You keep on crying about how you don't want to deal with people and fighting. If that's the case why not just lose it, kill everyone see if that makes you all better. If not oh well guess you'll just be the same lonely little boy with no one who loves him." After you finish, Serrell calmly gets up and leaves.</p>
        <p>You are left confused but happy you no longer have to deal with him.</p> 
        <p>However later that night you wake up to Serell with his sword pointing at your stomach.</p> <img src="Images/Serrell(Snapped).png" alt="Serrell" width=300/>
        <p>You end up his first victim, and the moment he hears your screams he grins with delight your last memory was him laughing in the night.</p>
