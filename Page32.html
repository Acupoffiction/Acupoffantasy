        Alexander (The Commanding Officer)
Alex is on a case to find out who is the culprit for the injuries on the villagers in a small village in a dense forest. He loves food-for-comfort foods and he seems like a very polite man. However, he has a hatred for Monsters especially Orcs and he wants nothing more than to get rid of them all.
