    <p>The next day you notice neither Serrell nor his Master Garret appeared all day. By the time the Moon appeared you assumed they had left until you see a familiar silhouette.</p>

<p>Hello there!"</p>
    <p>It was Serrell once more wearing a hood, he rushes towards you with a tired expression.</p>

<p>"I came to inform you that this is the last day before me and my Master needs to leave."</p>
    <p>You figured but that still did not stop you from making a frown.</p>

<p>"Do not need to look so sad, I'm positive we will see each other again, after all, I believe you are a traveler yourself are you not?"</p>
    <p>You nod in agreement but you still feel sad that you won't see Serrell again.</p>

<p>"Actually I wanted to talk to you about something, its what you said before about how I have the right to have space."</p>

<p>"I have gotten into an argument with my Master and we haven't spoken since."</p>

<p>"What happened?" You questioned wondering how could such an argument tore Serrell and his master apart.</p>

<p>"I told him about how I want to decide my own fate and not be chained to defeat this dark evil that may not even appear. He, of course, scolded me for such thoughts and said that it is my duty and my destiny to strike the darkness."</p>

<p>"Now I am unsure what to do now, I do not wish to be forced to follow destiny but..."</p>
    <p>Serrell clenches his hands into a fist, you cannot be able to tell what his expression is but it seems he is in deep thought. He then keeps looking up and down at you like he is expecting you to answer his woes. </p>
<p>'What should I tell him...'</p>

<a href="Page14.html"> Tell him to follow his destiny</a> 
<a href="Page15.html"> Tell him to follow his own path</a>
<a href="Page16.html"> Remind him of his childhood</a>
