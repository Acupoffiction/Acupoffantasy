    <p>"Yes you're right! What matters if the evil one comes there are many warriors out there, many stronger than me."</p> 
        <p>"I am still unsure of who I want to be but I know I do not want to be the chosen one, I want to be myself!"</p>

<p>The next day Serrell told Garret the news and Garret became more furious than ever but begrudgingly let Serrell go and decide what he wants to do.</p>
   <p> With this newfound freedom, he is at a lost so, for now, he decides to be your bodyguard against the monsters that roam the land. </p>
      <p> Many years pass and it seems like there was no evil at all for how long it has been, so with this in mind you decided to set up shop somewhere with Serrell in toll.</p>

<p>"Sell! How many orders are left!" You shout out while multitasking brewing tea and making ice cream."</p>

<p>"One more left!"</p>

<p>"Perfect, tell them their order is done."</p>

<p>"You got it!"</p>

<p>When Serrell comes back you hand him over the plate of lavender tea with a small wooden bowl of vanilla ice cream.</p>

<p>"Mind telling them to enjoy their delights as well?"</p>

<p>"Already on it- Woah!" Serrell shouts as he almost trips spilling the tea and dessert you just made. You shout-</p>

<p>"Careful!" As he rushes towards the customers. Finally, the day is over and you close up shop.</p>

<p>"..."This may have been the most tiring day yet..."</p>

<p>"You got that right."</p>

<p>"So... shall we go to bed?"</p>

<p>"W-What?" Serrell realizing what he said shook his head in rapid motion as his face turns red.</p>

<p>"I-I mean to go to sleep n-nothing like that!" You look away bashfully and nod, Serrell sighs in relief and you both head to your separate beds.</p>
   <p> You try to go to sleep but it seems impossible as the awkward air in the room makes it too unconformable to close your eyes. You turn to Serell who seems to also try to go to sleep.</p>

<p>"Um... Sell?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I can't sleep."</p>

<p>"Me neither." An awkward silence takes place before you muster up the courage to ask.</p>

<p>"Could I sleep next to you?"</p>

<p>"S-Sure." You silently get on the bed and position yourself so you don't end up accidentally cuddling him. It seems like neither of you still can't sleep and just stare at the ceiling. Serell finally breaks the silence and turns to you with a shy smile.</p>

<p>"You know... I never imagined living a life like this. I always thought that my life would be nothing but chaos and bloodshed but instead, it is quiet and peaceful."</p>

<p>"I am really glad you convinced me to choose my fate, thank you for everything." Serrell says with such honesty you begin blush more than you did before.</p>

<p>"N-No worries." You both finally were able to sleep peacefully but not before thinking the same thoughts that you could not dare blurt out in front of each other.</p>

<p>'I love you...'</p>
