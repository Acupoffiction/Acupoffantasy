        Jessie (The Sassy Healer)
Jessie is on a case to find out who is the culprit for the injuries on the villagers in a small village in a dense forest. She is very picky with what she wants but she has a soft spot for strawberries. She seems very mean-spirited and rude but underlays a broken shell that won't let anyone near except Alex.
