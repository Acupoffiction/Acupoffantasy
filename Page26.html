<p>"I am Alexander Ryran one of the commanding officers of Murkell Kingdom's army."</p>

<p>"That must be a mouthful to remember..." Jessie sneered.</p>

<p>"And this is Jessie Kelskel, she is one of the best healers we have."</p>
 
<p>"It's a pleasure meeting you both, do you want something Alexander?" Alexander shook his head and continued to give you a kind smile.</p>
 
<p>"There is no need to waste your energy on me but thank you for asking and please call me Alex." </p>
 
<p>"We were sent here due to the reports of villagers being heavily wounded after coming into the forest. The attacks has increased so much to the point where they feel too unsafe to leave, that is where we come in to slay the orcs who are the cause of this."</p>

<p>"Orcs?"</p>
 
<p>"​You heard that right, they are the only monsters we've been hearing about from the villagers. Not to mention they have sharp claws that match the injuries that the villagers and now Alex." </p>
 
<p>"We were heading out to slay them then we got ambushed, didn't see what they were but Alex was sure it was an Orc." </p>
 
<p>"It was an Orc Jessie they are the only monsters out there and I know an Orc when I see one and that thing was an Orc."</p>

<p>"Is that why you tried to kill me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am terribly sorry I saw your green scarf and thought you were one of them. It will never happen again." Alex apologised putting his head down ashamed.</p>
