    <p>"You really think I should?"

<p>"Yes, I know that you don't want to be forced to do something you don't want to do but sometimes you just have to for everyone to be safe." Serell looks a bit disappointed but nods in agreement.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right, I will tell my Master of this and apologize. Thank you for the advice though, you are a really good friend."</p>

<p>"I'm just the one who is suppose to serve you coffee and yell at you to pay me." Serell chuckles a little before looking at you nervously with his right arm scratching his head.</p>

<p>"I've also been wondering... would you like to come with us?"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"I-I mean you do not have to, it just is nice to have someone who's not so... overwhelming at times besides your companionship really heals my wounds after a battle."</p>

<p>"I guess I should keep an eye on you who knows what could happen if you encounter a woman who wants nothing but to jump your bones." You end up having to calm Serell now due to him exploding in embarrassment trying to defend himself.</p>
    <p>The next day all is forgiven and you end up joining the party. Along the way you end up encountering more members in your party, sharing experiences, and battling different kinds of monsters. </p>
    <p>Eventually, your journey leads to the arrival of the great evil where he emerged in a large dark castle. You among four others look at the castle with determination.</p>

<p>"This is everyone. The final battle." Serell speaks with confidence in his voice but you know inside he is anxious for the battle that could end his life.</p>

<p>"Is everyone all healed up or do you need another hot chocolate serving?" You asked to ease everyone's tension.</p>

<p>"We are brimming with energy, you know if you keep filling us up will end up too relax to even fight." Garret smirked at you before heading closer to the door along with the other members. However, before you could join them Serrell puts his hand on your shoulder stopping you. He gives you a calm expression.</p>

<p>"Before we go in, I just tell you that if we die in there I want you to know that you're the closest friend I have ever had." Your eyes widen a little at how serious and honest he sounded and the look in his eyes proves it all. You smile at him and hold your hand out.</p>

<p>"We're not going to die but you are my best friend too, I'm glad we met at that rowdy town and I served you coffee." Serell looks at your hand for a second before shaking his head and pulls you into a hug. You wheeze a bit due to the amount of strength Serrell had but you give it right back with the most amount of strength you can muster. </p>

<p>You finally reunited with the others, took a deep breath and open the doors. </p>

<p>"Welcome band of heroes! You the fifth band I have seen today and you will not be the last! But oh there is something special about you... the sword of light?" </p>
    <p>"Well well well it is nice to finally meet your chosen one! Now let's begin!!"</p>
