    <p>You couldn't stop thinking about that quiet guy and wished to see him the next day. </p>
        <p>So the next day.You could not believe your eyes when you see the warrior walking around the square with Garret nowhere in sight. </p>
            <p>He turns to see you setting up your cart and waving over to him. He smiles back and heads over to you.</p>

<p>"Happy to see you again as well. But I thought you were leaving with that wizard guy." </p>

    <p>"Really? I was sure you would want to see my Master once more." Serell said with a bashful smile. </p>
       <p>"I was but I wanted to stay here a few more days to look around town, never know if there is a place to buy important items or weapons." You got ready to serve your first order. Serrell looked over the menu before deciding what he wanted.</p>
<p>"Could I have a coffee?"</p>
<p>"A coffee?"</p>
<p>"Yes, please." "Sure what would you like in it?" </p>
<p>"I am not sure I never heard of a drink like that before." </p>
    <p>"If that's the case how about I surprise you then." He nods and proceeds to wait, as you begin to make the coffee you wonder what kind of coffee you should make.</p>
