    <h1>A cup of Fantasy</h1>
    <h2>By Diamond Sears-Allen</h2>
    <p>This is a preview to a large project that will be worked on for a very long time. It is a simple visual novel that will later become a simulation RPG, you wake up in a new world with the purpose of a serving to your customers and listening to their stories as well as interact in events. You have one route to enter however in the future there will be 12 routes. I wanted to make this project because at first it was a small idea to which now converted into a big project that I wanted everyone to read and eventually play. The purpose of this project is for you to read and interact in the events shown in it.</p>

    <p>When a friend is in need, support them so they can fight in your steed!</p>
      <p>Collect all 12 characters to get them to battle for you, but don't think you can just sit back and relax. Collect ingredients across the region and level up by fighting monsters or serve customers to learn new recipes!</p>
