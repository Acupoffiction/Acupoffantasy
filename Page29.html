        Garrett (The Wise Wizard)
Garrett is a hero you meet in a town, he is the mentor of Serrell and he is fond of tea blends. He is rather boastful of his power and is very demanding at times but he believes it is all for the fate of Murkwell. It seems like he's just your typical wizard however it seems that he's hiding something.
