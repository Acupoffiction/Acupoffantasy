        Tawic (The Greedy Merchant)
Tawic is a merchant who is at war against your small cart, he loves wine and grapes. He wants nothing more than buy everything in the downtown market and has it be his including your cart. He even tries to make deals with you to get you to sell your cart to him. Guess it's up to you to make him less of a jerk.
