    <p>"You really think I should? Hmm... well if that is the right choice then I will but know this."</p>
    <p>"I will come back to see you again, thanks to you I feel more independent, that I can decide what I want to do and not based it not the people or my Master."</p>
    <p>Serrell and his Master Garret make up the next day, however, Garret decides to give Serrell a little bit of freedom allowing him time to think and not be thrust into combat every day.</p> 
    <p>A year pass before the Evil one returns to wreak havoc upon the world, but thanks to his training Serell defeats the evil and rids it from the world.</p>
    <p>You, on the other hand, have been traveling and cheering the poor citizens of Murkwell with your hot piping selection of drinks. </p>
    <p>Once the evil had been rid of you decided to set up shop somewhere and continue to serve tea, coffee and more to whoever would be delighted to try it.</p>
<p>You became known as the angel of warmth and a certain warrior has been looking for you. </p>

<p>You were getting ready to set up shop when someone walks in the doorway, you had an open sign up so you did not bother looking.</p>

<p>"Excuse me do you serve coffee here?" Said a rough yet familiar voice. You turn around with a mini notepad in hand to answer the man's question.</p>

<p>"Yes, what can I get you-" You gasp now seeing the man's face, he is now much taller than he was before, scars all over his face and arms. He also seems very tired but happy to see you.</p>

<p>"I told you, I would come back for you my beloved. So could I get a cup of coffee please?"</p>
