    <p>"My childhood? What is so important about that?" 
<p>Wasn't it unfair how everyone treated you when you had no power but the moment you got that sword everyone wanted to kiss your feet."</p> 

<p>"What are you getting at?"</p> 

<p>"I'm saying why should you help these people at all, you don't need to be the chosen one at all. You can use your power for your own gain, after all, who would be able to stop you? You're considered a God among these people."</p> 

<p>"Yes... why not... it is all coming back to me now... the yelling, the beatings, the isolation, all of it. All I wanted was to watch my village be destroyed and now I have the power to do as I wish." Serrell then stood up while chuckling.</p> 

<p>"Thank you for giving me advice... Why don't you come with me tomorrow? I will need someone to help me gather firewood..."</p> 
    
<p>"What about your Master?"</p> 

<p>"He will be dealt with do not worry, you should rest up for tomorrow though. It will be a scorcher..."</p> 

<p>The next day became the most blood-soaked day in the history of Murkwell with its first victim being Garret along with the town you first stepped in. </p> 
    <p>Everywhere you went there was fire and screams of horror, it had seen Serrell had fully embraced the darkness in his heart and became the evil one he was supposed to stop. </p> 
        <p>You were there with him the whole time being his only voice of sanity, you at first felt guilty for being the one who caused all of this but eventually you got over it and joined Serrell in the madness. </p> 
             <p>Many warriors. had come to stop you both but Serell became so powerful no one seemed to stop him. </p> 
            <p>Until one day a hero appeared with the power of darkness by his side.</p>
