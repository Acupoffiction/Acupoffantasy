    <p>"What about my childhood?"</p>

<p>"I'm saying that you shouldn't let people decide your fate even though you are supposed to protect them they still treated you wrong." Serell gives you a strange look, it seems as though he is trying to process what you said. Eventually, he nods to himself and muttered.</p>

<p>"Yeah... you're right..."</p>

<p>"Are you alright Serrell?" Serell nods still not really expressing much emotion, he gets up and prepares to leaves.</p>

<p>"I'm fine. Thank you for offering advice to my friend, would you mind if I come to see again tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Of course." He gives you one small smile before leaving but you could tell it was fake. It was sometime at midnight when you were shaking awake. You wake up to see Serrell staring you down.</p>

<p>"Wake up, you do not want to be caught in the fire..." Once he says that you begin to smell smoke and hear the crackling of flames.</p>

<p>"Wha-!"</p>

<p>"Come with me." Serell grabs your wrist and takes you out of your room, you gasp seeing blood across the walls and a few corpses on the ground. Outside becomes much worse with the screams of people shouting for help. </p>
    <p>Flames as big as waves were everywhere, on the roofs, floors, and people. You felt like you were about to pass out from the horror. Finally, Serrell leads you into the same alleyway you ran into.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are wondering why the town is on fire."</p>

<p>"Well you were right, I should not let people decide my fate. So I decided to take matters into my own hands and let them know to never push me around ever again." You notice all the blood on him and start to breathe heavily, terrified of what he did.</p>

<p>"Y-You burned the town... why?"</p>

<p>"I could not stand them grabbing at me anymore it was better this way now I will not any witness to report what happened here."</p>

<p>"...W-What happened to Garret?"</p> 

<p>"He wouldn't let Serrell do all this I know it!'</p>

<p>Serell chuckles before taking out his sword dipped in blood and other substances. </p>

    <p>"Oh him? I told him that I was tired of being his lapping dog and he kept yelling at me more and more about destiny and that I will do what he says or else.  So I had enough and used this to quiet him."</p>

<p>"Do not worry he will not bother us no more." Serell grins then walk towards you making you back up against a wall.</p>

<p>"U-Us?"</p>

<p>"Yes us, are you not coming with me?" He grips your shoulders in a violent grip yet he gives you puppy-dog eyes trying to make you feel sorry for him.</p>

<p>"It would be nice to have a friend, you know I never had friends till I met you. At first, I thought you were just another stranger who would fade away from my memory but you helped me, you saved my life, I have never felt so alive before." Serell laughs while tears pool from his eyes.</p>

<p>"Please don't leave me, I-I would go insane. I can't go on anymore without you! If you leave I would have to kill you please don't make me." You shuddered in fear. You had no choice in the manner otherwise he would kill you, so with tears starting to form in yours you say-</p>

<p>"I-I will." Serell giggles and hugs you before dragging you out of the town and into the mountains to find the next fresh kill. </p>
    <p>As months go by you sadly stand by him feeling you could try to save him from himself but alas he continues his slaughter but no worry he forever considers you his greatest ally and is forever grateful for your companionship. </p>
    <p>Now it is on you to make the choice should you kill him or join him in the chaos.</p>
