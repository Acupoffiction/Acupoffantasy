        Serrell (The Chosen Warrior)
Serrell is a hero you meet in a town, he is the apprentice of Garrett and he has quite the sweet tooth. He seems pretty bashful and polite however underneath he has a dark past that molds his true feelings. He doesn't know how to use magic that well but can use fire magic.
