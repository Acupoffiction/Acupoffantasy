    <p>You decided to make a traditional cup of coffee, one teaspoon of sugar with some milk and sugar. </p> 
        <p>You hand it over to him with anticipation, he picks it up with curiosity and takes a sip. He gives a small smile and takes his pace drinking it.</p>

<p>"This taste pretty good as well, thank you, my friend, how much will this be-."</p>

<p>Before Serrell could finish his sentence you both heard a loud gasp. A stranger points at him and shouts.</p>

<p>"It's him!" More people turn to look at him and begin to notice his appearance. They gasp and squeal rushing over to your cart.</p>

<p>"Our savior!"</p>

<p>"The chosen one returns with the sword of light in his possession!"</p>

<p>"Oh no..." Serrell begins to cringe feeling overwhelmed by the random strangers trying to grab him.</p>

<p>"What's going on?"</p>

<p>"Please come with me!"</p>
    
 <p>Before you could say anything, Serrell jumps up and grabs you away from the crowd, the crowd begins to chase you down throughout the town. Eventually, you both entered an alleyway and hide in there.</p>

<p>"Phew! They shouldn't find us here. I'm sorry I took you away from your shop I just didn't want you to be overrun by the crowd."</p>

<p>"It's alright just tell me what is going on." Serrell looks at you tired and sighs, he turns from you almost as if he is ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess after hearing them shout who I am you figured it out. I am the so-called chosen one, the one who will banish the evil and save us all from eternal doom, and with this sword, I found in some grass I'll defeat them all..." He says with no emotion in his voice.</p>

<p>"So your some kind of hero?"</p>

<p>"If you want to say that."</p>
 <p>You seemed a bit surprised that he was considering it seems like he has none of the charisma and confidence a hero would have.</p>
<p>"Well, you being a hero is not going to change the fact that you need to pay me."</p> 
    <p>Serrell looks at you surprised before chuckling. "Do not worry, I have all the gold to pay you." </p>
