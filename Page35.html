        Orc Tribe (The Misjudged Tribe)
You end up encountering them in the forest believing you're about to die however they help you instead. They eat whatever they hunt but are fine with anything, they are being targeted by the village and are believed to be the reason they are getting killed. Hopefully, you can protect them and find the real reason the villagers are getting attacked.
